🧠 Bitasmbl Backend

Welcome to the backend of Bitasmbl — a collaboration platform built to connect skilled developers and creators, enabling them to form teams, 
build real-world projects, and validate product ideas through hands-on experience.

🚀 What is Bitasmbl?

Bitasmbl is a platform that helps:

    Aspiring developers gain real-world project experience

    Innovators find collaborators with the right skillsets

    Teams build MVPs together and prove the value of their ideas
